# Internship

Objective: creating a web page ( back to front ) where i need to have a minimalist interface that will provide the user with DATA provided from a JSON. 

step1 - Research on tools and frameworks that allow me to get to my objective: 

        I had 3 choices in this matter - working on javascript || Python || PHP - where in JS i have Node.js ( with express.js ), in python i have Django and in PHP i have Laravel.
        
        My first choice was Node.js, since i already had some kind of experience in it and in javascript so i thought it would be more acssesible to work in this language. And after researching on django and laravel i realized that to reach my goal in the most clean way, Node.js is the right choice. During the research i saw that using Express.js is so much more minimalist than the other options. 

        Final Choice on step1 - Javascript framework: Node.js with Express.js 

Step 2 - research on ways to deal with a JSON file with Node.js
